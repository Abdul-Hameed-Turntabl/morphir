#Morphir

**Morphir** is a multi-language system built on a data format that captures an application's domain model and business logic in a technology agnostic manner. Having all the business knowledge available as data allows you to process it programatically in various ways:

- **Translate it** to move between languages and platforms effortlessly as technology evolves
- **Visualize it** to turn black-box logic into insightful explanations for your business users
- **Share it** across different departments or organizations for consistent interpretation
- **Store it** to retrieve and explain earlier versions of the logic in seconds
- and much more ...
