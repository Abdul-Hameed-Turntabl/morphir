## Why use Mophir
You're application has intellectual property. It might be in the form of calculations, business rules applied to requests, or categorizing and sorting large sets of data.  Collectively this forms your Application Intellectual Property (AIP).  Your AIP is its most important asset - its whole reason that exists.  You need to protect this asset.  You also want to do useful things with it.  

For starters, you definately want it to **[function correctly](./function_correctly)**.  Ideally, it could do so **[across different technologies and platforms](./work_across_languages_and_platforms)**.  You also want to **[share the knowledge](./share_the_knowledge)** to your application's stakeholders. This gives them **[confidence](./build_confidence)** in what you're delivering.  It also makes supporting and learning about your application easier.  The world is changing fast, so you want all of this while you **[deliver quickly and efficiently](./development_automation)**.
