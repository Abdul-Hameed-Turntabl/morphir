# The Morphir Background Story
Morphir evolved from the convergence of new business requirements and technical upgrades. Basically, we needed to do a lot of work all at once.  During that time, our business users issued a challenge to the technology teams:

## The Challenge

> **Stop the cycle of rewrites** - Our users recognized that we were in a constant cycle of upgrading technology.  Each pass in the cycle required significant effort and posed the risk of implementing core business logic incorrectly.

> **Stop making us use multiple applications with inconsistent values** - Our users noticed that different systems came to different results for what should theoretically been the same calculations.  As a result, they had to navigate across applications to get the information they needed.

> **Show us that the system is behaving correctly** - Our users demanded that if we were going to rewrite core business logic again, we needed to provide transparency so that they could understand exactly how the system was behaving with respect to the business.

> **Deliver faster** - A never ending desire request.

## Common Cause
This challenge made us re-examine our whole development process.  It soon became clear that there was a theme across them:  **The fundamental cause was the fact that the business knowledge was tightly wrapped into the technologies of the moment**.  It stood to reason that freeing the business knowledge from the technology would address these challenges.  That's the approach we took and that is what eventually evolved into Morphir.

## Morphir In Action
Let's take a look at what that all means and how Morphir works to address these challenges.  Let's consider a component of online store application.  The purpose of this application is to decide on
